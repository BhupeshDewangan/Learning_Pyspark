"PySpark" : Python API for Apache Spark, enables distributed data processing on big data, optimizing speed and scalability for large-scale data analytics and machine learning tasks.

I found an amazing platform - "Databricks" a web-based platform for working with Spark, that provides automated cluster management and IPython-style notebooks, Data Warehousing, Data Management, Data Science, and Machine Learning Pipelines.
